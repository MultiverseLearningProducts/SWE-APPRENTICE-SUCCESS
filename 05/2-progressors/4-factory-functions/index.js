/* Define a new factory function called createLap
    The function will take the following argument and set them as properties of any new instance.
            * @param {number} lapDistance -  in metres

    The function will also set two more properties:
            totalDistance = 0
            this.splits = []
            
    Method to define
        addLap
            * @param {number} lapTime
            pushes the lapTime to the splits array
            adds lapDistance to the totalDistance
